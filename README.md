 **Introduction**
The Health Organization Chatbot is designed to provide users with instant responses to common health-related queries. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user inputs and respond accordingly.

**Features**
Health-related responses: Provides information and advice on various health topics such as headaches, stomachaches, coughs, fevers, and more.
Interactive Follow-ups: Engages users with follow-up questions to provide more personalized responses.
QR Code Integration: Allows users to access the chatbot via a QR code.

**Technologies Used**
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Streamlit: For the web interface
- QR Code: For generating QR codes
- Pillow: For handling image data
- Installation
- Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

**Clone the repository:**

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-organization-chatbot.git
cd health-organization-chatbot
Install dependencies:
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download NLTK data:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
Ensure you have the intents.json file:
Make sure intents.json is in the root directory of the project.

**Usage**
To run the chatbot, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will start a Streamlit web application where you can interact with the chatbot.

Training the Model
If you need to retrain the model, follow these steps:

Prepare your intents data in intents.json.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train_chatbot.py
This script preprocesses the data, builds the neural network model, and trains it on the provided intents. The trained model, along with the word and class data, is saved to disk.

**Intents JSON Structure**
The intents.json file should follow this structure:

json
Copy code
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greeting",
      "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey", "Howdy", "What's up"],
      "responses": [
        {"response": "Hi there! How can I help you today?", "follow_up": null},
        {"response": "Hello! What brings you here today?", "follow_up": null},
        {"response": "Hey! How are you doing?", "follow_up": null}
      ]
    },
    // Additional intents...
  ]
}

**Example Intents**
Here are some example intents included in the intents.json file:

greeting: Patterns like "Hi", "Hello", "Hey" with responses like "Hi there! How can I help you today?"
headache: Patterns like "I have a headache", "My head hurts" with responses providing advice on managing headaches.
stomachache: Patterns like "I have a stomachache", "My stomach hurts" with responses suggesting remedies for stomachaches.
